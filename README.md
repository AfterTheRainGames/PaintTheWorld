# Paint the World  
**Game Jam Submission**  
*DEFENSE Theme | Limitation: Minimal Control | August 16-19, 2024*

## Overview  
**Paint the World** challenges players to traverse colorful environments, shooting paint at NPCs in order to restore color to the world. Aim your mouse to fire paint balls at NPCs located in tricky situations in order to return them their color.

## Key Contributions as a Gameplay Engineer  
### **Concept Development**  
  - Designed an engaging, action-based gameplay loop focused on dynamic mouse movement and puzzle-solving through the use of paint.  
  - Focused on a single, continuous level to provide a cohesive, uninterrupted gameplay experience. The level scales in difficulty, with obstacles becoming harder to shoot past as the level progresses.

### **Player Movement and Mechanics**  
  - Developed responsive mouse movement registration system to ensure fluid player control.  
  - Integrated player feedback systems, such as visual cues and sound effects, to enhance the player's experience.

### **Audio and Aesthetics**  
  - Integrated sound effects for paint-related actions.
  - Developed a vibrant, artistic environment to complement the colorful paint mechanic.
  - Included a very upbeat background song to convey the happy vibe of the enviornment to the player.

## Challenges Overcome  

### **Paint-Interaction Triggers**  
  - **Issue**: Paint didn't always interact correctly with environmental elements, leading to frustrating gameplay.  
    - **Solution**: Replaced mesh colliders with sphere colliders to allow NPCs to have a more lenient hitbox.

## Reflection  
Paint the World was an exciting project where I explored creating a continuous, auto-scrolling shooter. With only one long level, I had the opportunity to craft a seamless experience that gradually increases in difficulty while keeping the gameplay challenging and engaging. This project is a testament to the power of simple mechanics and careful level design.
