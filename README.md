## Challenges Overcome  

- **Player Movement and Collision**  
  - **Issue**: Early versions of the movement felt stiff, with issues of collision when jumping or interacting with the environment.  
  - **Solution**: Tweaked the player’s Rigidbody and collider setup, adding velocity boosts to smooth out jumping and climbing motions.

- **Paint-Interaction Triggers**  
  - **Issue**: Paint didn't always interact correctly with environmental elements, leading to frustrating gameplay.  
  - **Solution**: Refined trigger logic and added visual feedback (such as glowing platforms) to ensure interactions were intuitive and rewarding.

- **Puzzle Complexity**  
  - **Issue**: Some puzzles were either too difficult or not engaging enough.  
  - **Solution**: Iterated on puzzle design to balance difficulty while introducing new mechanics progressively, ensuring players would feel challenged without frustration.

- **Level Flow**  
  - **Issue**: Some sections felt disconnected, breaking the game’s pacing.  
  - **Solution**: Redesigned certain levels to improve flow and visual guidance, using environment cues to direct players seamlessly between sections.
