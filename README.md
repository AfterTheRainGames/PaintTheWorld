## Key Contributions as a Gameplay Engineer  
### **Concept Development**  
  - Designed an engaging, action-based gameplay loop focused on dynamic mouse movement and puzzle-solving through the use of paint.

### **Player Movement and Mechanics**  
  - Developed responsive mouse movement registration system to ensure fluid player control.  
  - Integrated player feedback systems, such as visual cues and sound effects, to enhance the player's experience.

### **Audio and Aesthetics**  
  - Integrated sound effects for paint-related actions.
  - Developed a vibrant, artistic environment to complement the colorful paint mechanic.
